# Units

Something I've found useful when doing calculations for my Digital Electronics Class.

```julia
1E  == 1.0e18
1P  == 1.0e15
1T  == 1.0e12
1G  == 1.0e9
1M  == 1.0e6
1k  == 1.0e3
1h  == 1.0e2
1da == 1.0e1
1d  == 1.0e-1
1c  == 1.0e-2
1m  == 1.0e-3
1u  == 1.0e-6
1n  == 1.0e-9
1p  == 1.0e-12
1f  == 1.0e-15
1a  == 1.0e-18
```

It's just nicer to write quick equations down like this.
